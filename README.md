# <Horiseon Landing Page>

## Description

The motivation and purpose behind this project was to make the code behind a basic website more organized while retaining functionality. The completion of this project has helped me to more fully understanding how HTML and CSS interplay with each other. I learned how to more effectively organise code in these two styles to make simple functional pages.
